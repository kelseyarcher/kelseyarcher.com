        I am currently working on updating a BlackJack application.
        I developed the application in Swift using SwiftUI.
        The application is a replication of the BlackJack card game minus making bets.
        The application was initally rejected from the App Store.
        This was because it was mistakenly identified as containing gambling.
        It took some back and forth with the application review team to resolve this issue, 
        but the aplication was approved.
        It was published on the App Store at the end of 2022!
        In my next update, 
        I plan to add a start menu with links to the game screen and rules.
        I will also add a database to keep track of the users game history.
